# PolyEngine
Welcome to PolyEngine, Coded by _polyScripts._
PolyEngine is currently in the _prototype_ phase of development. To use PolyEngine, you must have a version of Visual Studio 2022 and DirectX12 installed.
There is currently alot of errors in the program so if you would like to help me fix them, please make a issue or a pull request so we can work on the problem together!

# _PolyScripts_ made this project, no one else.


_UPDATE: POLYENGINE WILL NOT BE UPLOADED UNTIL IT IS IN ALPHA. NO ONE CAN USE IT UNLESS I GIVE THEM EARLY ACSESS._
